# Datasets
This repository contains a couple of datasets that i've gathered and created over the years.

## List of datasets
* `amsterdam-buurtcodes.csv` - Contains codes for 'stadsdelen', 'buurtcombinaties' and 'buurten' in the municipality of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This is a combination of multiple datasets, but most prominently [this 'officiële bekendmaking'](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/gmb-2015-56979.html) that only lists the codes in text and not as structured data.
* `nl-gemeentes-cbs-wikidata.csv` - All Dutch municipalities with Wikidata ID and population according to the CBS on January 1st, 2016.
* `gtaa-full.csv` - An old (March 2015) dump of [GTAA](http://gtaa.beeldengeluid.nl/) ids with changeNote, scopeNote, hiddenLabel, inScheme and prefLabel fields.
