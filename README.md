# Datasets
This repository contains a couple of datasets that i've gathered and created over the year and find useful.

## List of datasets
* `amsterdam-buurtcodes.csv` - Contains codes for 'stadsdelen', 'buurtcombinaties' and 'buurten' in the municipality of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This is a combination of multiple datasets, but most prominently [this 'officiÃ«le bekendmaking'](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/gmb-2015-56979.html) that only lists the codes in text and not as structured data.
